These files contain the built-in strings shown to participants.

.po files can be edited in [Poedit](https://poedit.net/),
or directly as plain text. In GitHub, click the "pencil" icon to edit the file,
then make a pull request. Once I have reviewed and accepted the translation,
it will be incorporated into the next release of oTree
(usually within a couple of weeks).
